Convex Optimization Course Project: SVM and Algorithm

In this project, we delve into the realm of convex optimization, focusing specifically on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their underlying algorithms. One of the highlights of our exploration is the use of kernel methods, which allow us to transform and tackle non-linear classification problems effectively. We start by understanding the mathematical foundations of convex sets, functions, and kernel spaces. Leveraging this knowledge, we implement SVMs to solve both linear and non-linear classification challenges. The algorithms developed and utilized in this project serve as a testament to the power and versatility of convex optimization techniques. Through hands-on experimentation and rigorous analysis, we aim to showcase the practical applications and theoretical underpinnings of SVM in the world of machine learning and data science.

This revised description emphasizes the use of kernel methods in the context of SVM and convex optimization.
